Welcome to the course _Philosophical Logic_! (This website is currently still under construction.) It is given during the summer semester 2024 at _LMU
Munich_ as part of the _Master in Logic and Philosophy of Science_. This website contains all information and study material.

# General information

We have three session per week during the semster:

1. The _lecture_ given by me, on Thursdays from 10:15 - 11:45 in room 021 (Ludwigstr. 31)
2. The _exercise class_ given by Marta, on Mondays from 14:15 - 15:45 in room 028 (Ludwigstr. 31)
3. The _tutorial_ given by me, on Thursdays from 9:15 - 10:00 in room 021 (Ludwigstr. 31)

The lecture introduces the main content of the course, the exercise session discusses solutions to the homework exercises, and the tutorial covers background material, but can also be used to go into more detail of a particular topic (based on your demand).
