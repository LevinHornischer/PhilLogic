Welcome to the course _Philosophical Logic_! (This website is currently still under construction.) It is given during the summer semester 2024 at _LMU Munich_ as part of the _Master in Logic and Philosophy of Science_. 


# Motivation 

Often, what is understood by 'logic' is classical logic (either classical propositional logic or classical first-order logic). Its typical features are, for example, that a sentence `p` is either true or false and that `not not p` is the same as `p`. In many situations, though, simply assuming classical logic is not appropriate. Such situations arise, as we'll see, in philosophy and neighboring disciplines (like mathematics, computer science,
and linguistics). For example, when reasoning with: vague concepts, incomplete or inconsistent data, conditionals (i.e., 'if, then' sentences), and what it means to be true. The course will be about exploring different logics to model these (and other) phenomena.

# General information

We have three sessions per week during the semester:

1. The _lecture_ given by me, [Levin Hornischer](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/hornischer_levin/index.html), on Thursdays from 10:15 to 11:45 in room 021 (Ludwigstr. 31).
Here the main content of the course is introduced. Below you find a schedule of when we cover which topic. (This is `10111 Philosophical Logic` on LSF.)

2. The _exercise class_ given by [Marta Esteves](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/doct_fellows/esteves_marta/index.html), on Mondays from 14:15 to 15:45 in room 028 (Ludwigstr. 31). Here the solutions to the homework exercises are discussed. (This is `10105 Additional Tutorial "Philosophical Logic"` on LSF.)
  
3. The _tutorial_ given by me, [Levin Hornischer](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/hornischer_levin/index.html), on Thursdays from 9:15 to 10:00 in room 021 (Ludwigstr. 31). Here we cover background material, but we can go into more detail of a particular topic of the lecture (based on your demand). (This is `10132 Exercise course "Philosophical Logic"` on LSF.) 



# Lecture Notes

You find the latest edition of the lecture notes in this file: [`phillog.pdf`](phillog.pdf). They are updated as the course progresses. 


# Formalities

All the organizational details for the course are described in this file: [`formalities.pdf`](formalities.pdf).


# Schedule
